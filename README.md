<p align="center">Jokes apart, hi! My name is Livia and I'm a programming student from Brazil.</p>

<br>I already had contact with C, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, SQL, PHP and Python, but that doesn't mean that I know how to program in these languages perfectly.

<br><strong>Why programming?</strong> 

I always had love puzzles and solve problems, so programming is a real amusement park for me.

<br>Of course, programming in real life is completely different from programming in animes (sometimes), but it's still cool, right?

<h3 align="center"><strong>SO, LET'S CODE!</strong></h3>
